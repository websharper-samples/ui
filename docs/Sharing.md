# Sharing

We opt for explicit ML-style sharing (handling of identity).  F#
programmers would know the difference between these two code
fragments:

```fsharp
let r = ref ()
fun () -> f r

fun () ->
    let r = ref ()
    f r
```

Similarly to ref cells, `Var`, `Doc` and `View` values have identity
that matters.  For DOM nodes this is used to encapsulate widget state.
`Var` are observable ref cells, so this approach is natural for them.
For the `View` layer, ML-style sharing allows constructing efficient
dataflow graphs.
